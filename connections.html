From the first days of the movement, long before 1848 and Seneca Falls, Ohio and Ohioans led the nation in campaigning for equal rights and opportunities for women.

<b>1828</b>
Frances Wright becomes the first woman in the United States to speak in public, launching what would become an international speaking career in the Hamilton County (Ohio) courthouse. An abolitionist and woman's rights activist dubbed "The Red Harlot of Infidelity," Wright persisted despite harsh criticism and threats of physical violence.

<b>1848</b>
Less than 2 months after his participation in the woman's rights convention at Seneca Falls, Frederick Douglass led the National Convention of Black Freemen in Cleveland, Ohio, which became the very first national convention to permit participation by women when a "Mrs. Sanford" was allowed to address the participants.

<b>1850</b>
Activists in Salem, Ohio, host a statewide women's rights convention, the first convention to be run and organized entirely by women.

<b>1869</b>
Inspired by events he witnessed at the 1850 Salem Convention as a young man, John Allen Campbell, first territorial governor of Wyoming, signs into law a bill establishing Wyoming as the first place in the United States to extend equal suffrage to women.

<b>1869</b>
The American Woman Suffrage Association is formed at a meeting in Cleveland, Ohio.

<b>1870</b>
Victoria Woodhull, of Homer, Ohio, becomes the first female candidate for president of the United States.

<b>1872</b>
The Liberal Republican party, formed in 1870, holds its only national convention in Cincinnati in 1872. Susan B. Anthony and Mrs. Laura DeForce Gordon (California) ask to be admitted.

<b>1876</b>
The Republican party holds its national convention in Cincinnati; Frederick Douglass addresses the convention on the first day (June 14). Sarah J. Spencer of the National Woman Suffrage Association is permitted 10 minutes to address the convention; a memorial written by Susan B. Anthony is presented. 

<b>1880</b>
The Democratic party holds its national convention in Cincinnati; Susan B. Anthony is permitted to ascend to the platform, but a clerk reads the Memorial from the NWSA presented to the convention. NWSA representatives include Matilda Joslyn Gage, Sarah Andrew Spencer, Ellen H. Sheldon, and Jane H. Spofford in addition to Anthony.

<b>1903 to 1910</b>
The National American Woman Suffrage Association is headquartered in Warren, Ohio.

<b>1904</b>
Suffragist Pauline Perlmutter Steinem (grandmother to activist Gloria Steinem) is elected to the Toledo school board, possibly becoming the very first Jewish woman elected to public office in the United States.

<b>1920</b>
Suffragists declare Ohio as crucial to final effort for ratification in Tennessee as they seek the aid and influence of presidential candidates Warren G. Harding (Marion, Ohio) and George M. Cox (Dayton, Ohio).
