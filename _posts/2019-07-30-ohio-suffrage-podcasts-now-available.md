June saw the launch of a new 6-minute podcast series entitled â€œThe Genius of Liberty," about Ohio and the fight for women's right to vote. Named for "The Genius of Liberty," a feminist paper published in Cincinnati in the early 1850s, the podcast series is hosted by Hillary Copsey and produced by Chris Messick of Cincinnati's Mercantile Library. Katherine Durack, independent scholar, researches, writes, and voices the stories. The theme music is Battle Hymn of the Republic medley, created and performed by Marisa Anderson. The original words to the Battle Hymn were written by suffragist Julia Ward Howe, and the tune, with different words, later became a suffrage anthem.

Eight episodes of The Genius of Liberty are currently available; additional episodes will be released throughout the suffrage centennial year, June 2019-August 2020. You can listen to The Genius of Liberty on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thegeniusofliberty" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> or subscribe through Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app.
