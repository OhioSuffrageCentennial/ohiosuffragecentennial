Exciting news! The first installment of the <a href="https://documents.alexanderstreet.com/VOTESforWOMEN" target="_blank">Online Biographical Dictionary of the Woman Suffrage Movement in the United States</a> (OBD) is now available FREE online!

The OBD is edited and compiled by Thomas Dublin and represents the work of hundreds of volunteers who have researched, written, copyedited, and fact-checked the first 950 biographical sketches that appear in this first installment. *950!!*

The publisher plans to add 500 more biographical sketches every 6 months until the project is completed in June 2021 with approximately 3,300 biographical sketches available online.

The OBD will will include substantial numbers of black women suffragists, militant suffragists associated with the National Womanâ€™s Party, and mainstream suffragists of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.

**The project still needs volunteers for a third of the sketches.** Contact tdublin@binghamton.edu if you are interested in volunteering. Volunteers are also needed for copyediting completed sketches and using genealogical skills to find birth, marriage, and death records for suffrage activists. This is a great chance to join a project commemorating the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.
