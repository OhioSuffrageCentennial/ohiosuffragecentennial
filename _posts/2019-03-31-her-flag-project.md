Artist Marilyn Artus will travel the US this summer to commemorate the suffrage centennial with the <a href="https://www.herflag.com/" target="_blank">Her Flag</a> project. For the collaborative art project, women artists who live in the 36 states that ratified the 19th Amendment will design each stripe on Her Flag. Beginning in June 2019, Artus will stitch each stripe onto the flag in each stateâ€™s capitol city. <a href="https://www.herflag.com/#call-for-artists-section" target="_blank">Ohio is 6th on the list</a>!
