<a href="https://www.herflag.com/" target="_blank">Her Flag</a>, a project to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of women's right to vote, is seeking entries from women in all 36 states that ratified the 19th amendment. The selected artists will each receive a $1000 stipend to design a stripe to represent their state, and all the stripes will be sewn together into "Her Flag" to commemorate the centennial.
