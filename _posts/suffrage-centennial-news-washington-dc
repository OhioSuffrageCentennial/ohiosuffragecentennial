If you're traveling to Washington DC to celebrate the 2019-2020 suffrage centennial, you'll have some great options!

The US Congressional Commission that studied a potential American Women’s History Museum in Washington DC presented <a href="http://amwh.us/report/" target="_blank">its final report</a> and concluded that women’s history is integral to the American story. The Commission recommended creating the American Women’s History Initiative at the Smithsonian. You can register to receive email updates about the initiative at <a href="https://womenshistory.si.edu/email" target="_blank">https://womenshistory.si.edu/email</a>.

Here are some of the exhibitions planned for 2019 and 2020:
* <a href="https://npg.si.edu/exhibition/votes-for-women" target="_blank">Votes for Women: A Portrait of Persistence</a> at the National Portrait Gallery (March 28, 2019 - January 5, 2020).
* <a href="https://www.si.edu/exhibitions/all-work-and-no-pay-history-womens-invisible-labor-event-exhib-6338" target="_blank">All Work and No Pay: A History of Women's Invisible Labor</a> at the National Museum of American History (March 4, 2019 – February 2020).
* <a href="https://www.sites.si.edu/s/topic/0TO1Q000000U31EWAS/girlhood-its-complicated" target="_blank">Girlhood (It’s Complicated)</a> at the National Museum of American History (June 2020, followed by an 18-month tour in 10 cities).

In Fall 2019, the Smithsonian is also publishing a book, *Smithsonian American Women: Women’s History from the National Collection* (working title), that showcases the institution’s rich collection of art and artifacts that tell the story of women’s contributions to art, history, science, culture and education.
