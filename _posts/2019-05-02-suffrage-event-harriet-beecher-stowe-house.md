Ohio's Role in Woman Suffrage: Three Reasons to Celebrate the 2020 Women's Vote Centennial (Sunday, May 5, 2019 at 4:00 p.m.)

**Tickets at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ohios-role-in-woman-suffrage-three-reasons-to-celebrate-the-2020-womens-vote-centennial-tickets-56671134890" target="_blank">Eventbrite page</a>.**

In this talk, Katherine Durack will share information about the crucial yet forgotten role Ohio played in the fight for woman suffrage. 

For instance, did you know that the woman's rights movement in the United States has deep roots in abolition and connections to Cincinnati? That if it hadn't been for an 1850 Ohio woman's rights conference, the territory of Wyoming might not have become the first place in the United States to extend equal suffrage to women (in 1869)? That Cincinnati was the site of a National Woman Suffrage Conference in 1855, and the conference was opened by an internationally regarded speaker and immigrant, a Polish woman whose father was a Rabbi? Or that without Ohio, Tennessee might not have become the final state to ratify the 19th amendment, making equal suffrage the law of the land?

Tickets are $7 for the general public and free for Harriet Beecher Stowe House menbers. **Get tickets at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ohios-role-in-woman-suffrage-three-reasons-to-celebrate-the-2020-womens-vote-centennial-tickets-56671134890" target="_blank">Eventbrite page</a>.**
